# Coming Soon......

## FloraSync.github.io

The public facing site for FloraSync.  This will be a general information site for the project.  We'll probably write this in React or Vue.  

## Running locally in development mode

To get started, clone the repository and `run npm install && npm run dev`:

```
git clone git@github.com:FloraSync/FloraSync.github.io.git
cd src
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Building and deploying in production

To run this site in production, you should install modules, then build it with `npm run build` and run it with `npm start`:

```
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```
